# Tarkat app

Short:
Application for fast check-in/out using barcode.

Story:
Imagine you are organizing event. During event, your attendees will have unique QR identifiers printed on their badges. You can use the app to track attendees' activities in real time. Here is simple exapmle how:

Imagine Liza. She ordered pizza for her event, let's say for 100 people. Everything seems ok, because she has 100 attendees. Liza is responsible for distributing pizza fairly, so that everyone gets equal amount. She established several distribution points to handle the big load. Here begins most interesting part! There is a tricky guy named Steve. He attends Liza's event. During the meal time, he was able to get seevral meals from different distribution points. Those distributors weren't able to know that he already had taken a meal, due to absence of any checking system. Now, because Steve got more meals than he was supposed to and Liza ordered meals for exact number of attendees, someone won't get a meal ☹️

And now we have an Emily. She organizes exactly same event and Steve attends it as well. Steve again plans to make a tricks with meal. During meal time, he goes to tne first delivery point and gets his pizza (everything is ok, he is supposed to get one), but this time distributor James scanned the barcode on his badge using Tarkat app and he was automatically checked in. Steve goes to another distribution point and asks for a pizza. Distributor Dan scanned his barcode using Tarkat app and it immediately warned him, that Steve already had taken one. Dan kindly asks Steve to be conscientious. Now all attendees got equal meals and everyone was happy 🎉

This is just one of the many examples how Tarkat can make people happier and ease life of event organizers 🙂
